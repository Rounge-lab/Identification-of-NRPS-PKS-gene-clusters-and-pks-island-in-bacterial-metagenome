# Identification of NRPS and PKS gene clusters, particularly the \emph{pks} island, in bacterial genomes from CRCbiome

This repository contains all code and scripts developed for the master's project "Identification of NRPS and PKS gene clusters, particularly the \emph{pks} island, in bacterial genomes from CRCbiome".

Three Snakemake-based pipelines have been developed. For a detailed description of each pipeline, please refer to the links below.
1. [MAG-based identification of BGCs (not executed)](https://github.com/Rounge-lab/Identification-of-pks-positive-bacterial-genomes-in-CRCbiome/blob/main/pipeline1/README.md).
2. [MAG-based identification of BGCs](https://github.com/Rounge-lab/Identification-of-pks-positive-bacterial-genomes-in-CRCbiome/blob/main/pipeline2/README.md).
3. [Read-based identification of the pks island and E. coli](https://github.com/Rounge-lab/Identification-of-pks-positive-bacterial-genomes-in-CRCbiome/blob/main/pineline3/README.md).

The programming language R have been used for data analysis after running the pipelines. R scripts can be accessed [here](https://github.com/Rounge-lab/Identification-of-pks-positive-bacterial-genomes-in-CRCbiome/tree/main/r-scripts).
